# CSStack

## Overview

<p> 
  Have you ever felt that positioning and styling mess a lot with your work organization?<br>
  If you use CSS without the assistance of any framework, for example, 
  your file starts getting too big, and if you use a framework like Bootstrap(which is amazing), 
  half of your HTML is destined for classes.
</p>
<p> 
  CSStack is a small-scale CSS Grid framework built in SASS focused on the construction of the page structure.
  It is simple and easy-to-use, aiming to keep the CSS only for styling(fonts, colors...) and 
  polluting it with less lines.
</p>
<p>
  It has a responsive columns feature mixed with 'a box inside a box' concept which helps 
  getting those nasty elements in the place you want.
